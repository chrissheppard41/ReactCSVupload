##### Van insurance guide

With increasing costs of living and budgets stretched everywhere in the UK, saving money might be a priority for some households. This may be especially true when shopping for the best vehicle insurance products as prices increase due to a rise in uninsured drivers. Put this together with escalating fuel costs and driving might seem prohibitively expensive for some. This is why more and more people are choosing to compare van insurance companies to ensure they get the best van insurance at a low cost.

Driving without insurance is illegal so unless an owner has declared a vehicle off road via a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) then they could well fall foul of the law.

Having appropriate vehicle insurance in place could be extremely important for a persons livelihood, especially if driving a white van or other commercial vehicle for business purposes, so finding the cheapest van insurance quote possible may be a priority.

**Different types of cover**


With any type of insurance quotation there tends to be different levels and types of cover. People might search for cheap van insurance in order to save money but getting the right type of commercial van insurance that is appropriate for a vehicle is likely to be more desirable. Cutting corners on insurance could be costly so using a UK van insurance provider that has a reputation for quality may be the best option long term.

The types of motor cover available when searching for van insurance quotes tend to be fully comprehensive, third party and third party fire and theft. Each one has different aspects of what a policy might cover; therefore it could be wise to explore the benefits of each one carefully before committing.

**Fully comprehensive van insurance**


Price wise, fully comprehensive cover is usually the cover that costs the most money. This is because it typically offers protection for the van, the driver and any property. Its still possible to acquire a very cheap van insurance policy which is fully comprehensive. It might also be possible to add on additional cover, such as breakdown protection or legal cover.

**Third party**


People often opt for third party cover as this could offer the cheapest van insurance available. This offers the basic cover that is legally allowed in the UK and could be ideal if the van to be insured is a low value or if a person only has a small budget.

Taking out only third party van insurance might be risky as it means being liable for the costs associated with replacing or fixing the vehicle owned by the policyholder. This type of policy tends to only pay out damages to the other parties involved. Choosing a greater level of cover might offer more peace of mind as third party van cover is likely to be just basic insurance protection.

**Third party fire and theft**


Like the above this type of van insurance cover offers basic protection at a low cost. However it also could provide cover for a van that is stolen or fire damaged so has extra benefits and is typically a lower cost than fully comprehensive cover.

**Finding a suitable policy**


Searching for very cheap van insurance to compare online tends to be the way many people choose to find cover. Comparing prices to find the cheapest van insurance is very typical before deciding on a particular policy to go with. What is useful about comparing quotes on van cover is that it could be tailored to different circumstances and therefore take into account individual details before returning the results. For example a young driver might think they will be charged a great deal for a van insurance policy. In reality it might be much easier to compare cheap van insurance UK and get a policy that takes into account their unique needs. The same might be said of a driver that has previous convictions and a comparison service could help them secure an affordable insurance rate.

**Van excess**


With any insurance policy it is more than likely that the policyholder could be required to pay the first part of any claim. This is known as the policy excess and could be variable depending on the insurance quote. A lower excess could in turn mean a higher premium and again using a comparison might be a good way of surveying the companies available to van drivers.

**Paying for a van insurance policy**


Many people like to stagger payments for their insurance policies and pay monthly which could cost more overall than paying in one go but might be more convenient. By paying a deposit and spreading payments over time it could make life easier although a policy tends to be cheaper overall if it is paid up front. To save even more cash there could be the option with some insurers to have a no deposit van insurance policy which might give people the option to distribute payments evenly over the term of the cover.

**Getting even cheaper van insurance**


People may drive a van as a second vehicle or use it for work rather than pleasure. As such they might have built up some years of no claims with a different vehicle. It could be possible that these be used on a new UK van insurance policy or transferred providing their benefit isn’t already being used elsewhere. It might also be possible to protect a no claims discount depending on the insurer used which could mean keeping the no claims benefit at renewal even if a person has had an accident during the previous year.

**Sealing the insurance deal**


It is always a good idea to read the details of a policy fully before committing. This way the policyholder knows exactly what they are signing up for. A van insurance comparison site could direct a person to the terms and conditions prior to finalising a deal so they can be certain the policy is right for them.
